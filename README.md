# Lab

All files are for either interfacing with lab equipment or data analysis.  Download what is needed for your application.  Specific tasks are separated by folder. Many of the files can be used standalone for testing purposes. Programs are object-oriented and GUI files will call what they need. These are setup to be the main interface with instrument control.
